## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javascript

### What I learned

I learn on how to setup and destructure the response that is coming from advice API well. add some feature like loading... since we are fetching from third party API, It's better user experience when the user knows that the data is on loading state.

### Continued development

I think some animation, just to make it more interactive.
